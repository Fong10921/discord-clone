## About This Project

This project is based on [Code with Antonio's tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZbX4Ok9YX94?si=irGZhw2uC9yiClC8), which covers building a full-stack application using **Next.js**.

I followed the core structure from the video and **extended the project** by adding a **Settings feature**, allowing users to customize certain aspects of their experience (e.g., profile updates, preferences, etc.).
